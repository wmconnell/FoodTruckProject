# FoodTruckProject

# Description
### This program allows you to input data for up to five food trucks, to include the truck's name, type of food, and rating. To use this program, type "I love food trucks" and follow the on screen prompts!

# Technologies Used
### For loops, while loops, switch statements, getters and setters, constructors, and multiple classes.

# What I Learned
### I learned that coding is extremely difficult. Diagnosing problems tends to lead to significantly more problems.. But it is very rewarding when all of the pieces fall into place. I have gained a better understanding of methods and classes, as well as how constructors work.
